Intro, 1st paragraph:
    - end 1st sentence after benefits. options to do so: ... benefits. Some of which fulfill ... OR ... benfits; some of which fulfill...
    - maybe change the first sentence to be more direct to your topic:
        - Throughout recent years, the wide array imaging methods have been developed and better constructed for scientific research. (basic idea)
       then after a clearer topic sentence you can discuss the vast options of imaging methods.(try to keep language here kind of basic/dumbed down). 
       - after stating some options of these methods, you can say something like: 
            - general paragraph layout: new topic sentence to start paragraph. describe basic imaging areas (x, y, and z.) "Even though many types of imaging methods that exist in modern-day science, the research conducted/the data gathered in this lab focused on using a specifc imaging method called Interference Pattern Structured Illumination Imaging (IPSII). Currently, IPSII is still in the stages of early development. This method consists of .... (explain what IPSII is and does). IPSII also has other iterations such as DEEP....

        - let's maybe make the intro paragraph into 2-3 paragraphs. (moving thesis statement to the end)
        
        intro:
        1. general opening and ipsii definition
        2. how it was generally used in the lab
        3. general stuff














    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
        There are various possibilites as to why this occurred. It could be due to misalignment of the object with respect to the projection of the beams or in relation to the reference pinhole. It could also be because of poor motor calibration and control, or a number of other things.
