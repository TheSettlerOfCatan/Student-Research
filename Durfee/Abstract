IPSII Aberration Simulation, Carter F. Day, Jarom Jackson, Dallin S. Durfee, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT. Using projected laser interference patterns, a new imaging method is being developed that circumvents conventional limitations. However, the projected pattern casts "shadows" when imaging objects with a lot of depth, so simulations are being run to determine viability of method. Preliminary tests will be discussed.
