# Student-Research
This repository contains files and programs from my time doing research as an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. My senior thesis for my bachelors degree is titled __*Effects of Illumination Shadows in Interference Pattern Structured Illumination Imaging*__. The Durfee/IPSII_II folder contains my most recent work on the project.
